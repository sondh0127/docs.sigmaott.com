The **system input** is the transmission of multimedia content to Sigma Machine. You must do some of your input signal system settings before you start working with **Sigma Transcode Live**.

There are two methods of transmission input:

* Push Method
* Drag Method

In this tutorial, for example, the input signal for the signal form is **MPEG-TS** transmitted by **multicast UDP**.

With the protocol taking the signal from the multicast UDP, it is necessary to be ready for the pull of the pull from the Sigma Packager already prepared for this signal via a pre-defined network card.

Record IP addresses of UDP flow and network cards that contain that signal to be set up at the next step. 2
